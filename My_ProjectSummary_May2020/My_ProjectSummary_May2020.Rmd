# Introduction
I am Elaheh Arjomand and I am doing a Post-doc fellowship on the subject of wellbore integrity and monitoring wells after being decommissioned. I completed my Ph.D. studying the integrity of the cement sheath in petroleum wells after being subjected to pressure and temperature variations at the University of Adelaide in 2018.

# My Project
In this project, the emphasis is placed on the investigations to determine the optimum approaches for monitoring wells after decommissioning in the Northern Territory.

In the current stage of the project, the aim is to familiarise ourselves with the petroleum wells database in the NT. The scope of this project is limited to onshore gas wells in the NT which also includes the decommissioning of exploration and production wells.

## Preliminary results
To get an overview of decommissioned and abandoned wells, we need to know:  
•	The number of wells abandoned and their distributions among all the basins in NT  
•	The time period at which the abandonment processes of **gas** wells has happened

```


### Specific investigations on Amadeus Basin
Amadeus Basin held the greatest number of abandoned wells in the NT. Therefore, further investigation on regards to the number of gas wells, the utilised legislations,the operators companies, and the rig release date (abandonment date) is required.

# My Digital Toolbox

What digital tools have you been using in your project? Do you expect that everything will be able 
to be completed within R, or will you need to work with multiple tools to get the right result?
Which of the digital skills needed for your project have you learned since starting Data School?

You can use all the usual R markdown features in writing a project summary, including lists:

* R - dplyr, ggplot, ...
* Python
* SQL
